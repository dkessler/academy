## Apply
- Story: 
	- As a pet clinic application user
	- I want to get immediate validation feedback on my owner `Telephone` input 
	- So that I get faster feedback

1) Create this story in Trello
2) Test drive this change
a) Similar test found in the AddPetPage constructor.
3) Make coding changes
a) The input fields use `th:replace` in `createOrUpdateOwnerForm.html `
b) The `th:replace` uses the fragment `inputField.html`. This is where your changes will go. Don't try to make changes to the input field in `createOrUpdateOwnerForm.html ` because they will just get replaced by the `th:replace`.
4) create a video demo for this user story

## Key Concepts
- External JavaScripts files are imported through the `<script>` tag in the `<head>`.
- The `src` attribute in `<script src="path\external_file_name.js"></script>` specifies the external javascript path and filename.
- The `</script>` close tag in `<script src="path\external_file_name.js"></script>` is required even though there is nothing between the open and close tag.  `<script src="sample.js"/>` is not valid.
- jQuery is a JavaScript library that allows web developers to add extra functionality to their websites.
- Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework for developing websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
- `$` is reserved for jQuery when you include jQuery in your HTML page.
- Regular Expressions (regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern to be searched for within a longer piece of text.
- Metacharacters are the building blocks of regular expressions. Characters in RegEx are understood to be either a metacharacter with a special meaning or a regular character with a literal meaning.
