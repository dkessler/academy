## Key Concepts
1. Java uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming style that is intended to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world.
1. Methods define behavior. A method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
1. When a method runs, the code jumps down to where the method is defined, executes the code inside of it, then goes back and proceeds to the next line.
1. You can also create a method that takes some data, called parameters, along with it when you call it. Write parameters within the method's parentheses.
1. The advantages of using methods instead of simple statements include the following:
   1. code reuse: You can write a method once, and use it multiple times, without having to rewrite the code each time.
   1. parameters: Based on the parameters passed in, methods can perform various actions.
1. The return keyword can be used in methods to return a value.
1. When you do not need to return any value from your method, use the keyword void.
1. The following choices are available for attributes and methods:
   1. default: A variable or method declared with no access control modifier is available to any other class in the same package.
   1. public: Accessible from any other class.
   1. protected: Provides the same access as the default access modifier, with the addition that subclasses can access protected methods and variables of the superclass (Subclasses and superclasses are covered in upcoming lessons).
   1. private: Accessible only within the declared class itself.
1. It's a best practice to keep the variables within a class private. The variables are accessible and modified using Getters and Setters. 
1. Getters start with get, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.
1. Setters start with set, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.
1. A constructor name must be same as its class name.
1. The constructor is called when you create an object using the new keyword. 
1. Java automatically provides a default constructor, so all classes have a constructor, whether one is specifically defined or not.
1. When you declare a variable or a method as static, it belongs to the class, rather than to a specific instance.
1. Itâ€™s a common practice to use upper case when naming a static variable.
1. Use the final keyword to mark a variable constant, so that it can be assigned only once.
1. The attributes are class level variables.
1. Java method, or `C` function, contains behavior.
1. Gradle, like make, is a general-purpose build tool.
