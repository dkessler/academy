## Apply
- This week's kata is a thought kata rather than a coding kata.  While you are welcome to start writing some code, the assignment is to share your approach for solving each of the pricing problems presented.  There's no right or wrong answer.  As developers we are regularly faced with the challenge of breaking down problems and coming up with ideas on how to solve them. Create a Trello board with your stories.

## Key Concepts
- Meaningful naming is cruitial in building clean code.
- Use Intention-Revealing Names
- The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions.
   - why it exists, 
   - what it does, 
   - and how it is used. 
- If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.
- Avoid names that create disinformation.
- Use pronouncable names so that developers can easily talk about and understand the code.
- Use easily searchable names
- Avoid variable member prefixes
- Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names
- Methods should have verb or verb phrase names
- Choose clarity over cute or entertaining names.
- Pick a single name for each concept. Avoid using the same word for two purpose.
- Place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, and namespaces.
- The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background.
- We can apply the final keyword to class, method, field, variable and method parameter declarations.
- Making a class final means that it won’t be possible to extend that class
- Adding final to a method means that it won’t be possible to override that method
- Finally, putting final in front of a field, a variable or a parameter means that once the reference has been assigned then it cannot be changed
- The finally block is an optional block use with a try/catch statement that is always called even if an exception is thrown.
- And finally, the finalize method is a protected method, defined in the Object class. It’s called by the garbage collector on objects that aren’t referenced anymore and have been selected for garbage collection.
