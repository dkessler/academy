## Key Concepts
- Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)is a set of Web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications.
- The term asynchronous is usually used to describe communications in which data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream. For example, a telephone conversation is asynchronous because both parties can talk whenever they like.  A synchronous telephone conversation would require each person to wait to speak until the other person was done talking.  Each person would block the other person in a synchronous model.
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types.
- A JavaScript object is a hash table containing key/value pairs.
- A JavaScript object starts with `{` and ends with `}`.
- A Callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name 'call back'.
