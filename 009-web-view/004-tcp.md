## Key Concepts 
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation via which application programs can exchange data.
- MVC (Model View Controller) is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input). The MVC model or "pattern" is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces.
- The model is the central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. The model only communicates with the Controller. 
- A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The View only communicates with the Controller.  
- The third part or section, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.  It acts as a middle man between the View and the Model.  
- Templating Engines enable web pages to render different data for each user.  This is called a dynamic page.  Templating Engines plug information into a template and from this populated template it renders an HTML page for the web.  
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Templating Engines that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages. 
- A Java servlet is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server.
