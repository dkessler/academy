## Key Concepts 
- Web server: is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.
- Markup language: is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.
- https is a secure protocol that uses encryption to secure web interactions. 
- HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
- All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories). The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:
    - 1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
    - 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
    - 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
    - 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
    - 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
- HTTP Headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response.
- An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
- An IP Address is a 4 part address containing non-negative numbers separated by `.`.  For example 10.20.30.40 could be an IP address.
