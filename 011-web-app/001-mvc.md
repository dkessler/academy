## Try
- Read through the 10 Java interview questions.
- https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/java-interview-questions/#basic

## Apply
- Story: 
	- As a pet clinic owner
	- I want to save a pet owner's home zip code
	- So that I will be able to send mail to their home address

1) Create this story in Trello
2) Test drive this change through the:
a) AddOrUpdateOwnerPage acceptance test
b) OwnerControllerIntegrationTests integration test
c) OwnerRepositoryTest integration test
3) Add a zip code input to createOrUpdateOwnerForm.html
4) Add a required zip code field to Owner.java
5) Update the data.sql to include a zip code in the owner insert statements
6) create a video demo for this user story

## Key Concepts
- Frameworks tend to favor convention over configuration.  This means that frameworks provide simple common sense setups that can be modified for custom behavior.
- Wrapper classes converts the java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it. These are known as wrapper classes because they “wrap” the primitive data type into an object of that class. 
- In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.
- There are two types of constructors:
     - Default constructor
     - Parameterized constructor
- Singleton class is a class is only instantiated once after the application is started.  In other words there is only one instance of the singleton class within the JVM.
- The `equals()` method compares two objects based on the implementation of the `equals()` method.  For `String` equals compares the string value.( `"first".equals("first"); //true`)
```
public class Car {
    private int year;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Car car) {
        return year == car.year; //The cars are equivalent if the model year is the same.
    }
    ...
    
Car first = new Car(2018);
Car second = new Car(2019);
Car third = new Car(2019);

first.equals(second) // false
second.equals(third) // true
```
- The `==` or equality operator compares primatives (`1 == 1`; //true)
- The `==` or equality operator also compares objects based memory location
```
Door first = new Door();
Door second = new Door();

first == second; // false
first == first; // true
second == second; // true

first = second; // assigns the second instance to the variable first
first == second; // true
```
