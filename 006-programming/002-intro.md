## Key Concepts
1. In Java, each code statement must end with a semicolon.
1. A block of Java code is surrounded by `{` and `}`
1. Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!
1. In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
1. public static void main(String [] args)
	1. public: anyone can access it
	1. static: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method
	1. void: method doesn't return any value
	1. main: the name of the method
1. A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes and continues until it reaches the end of the line. **Comments should be avoided (Clean Code ch 4)**
1. Multi-line comments start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk, and ends with an asterisk followed by a forward slash. 
1. The modulo (or remainder) math operation performs an integer division of one value by another, and returns the remainder of that division. 
1. The NOT (!) logical operator is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the NOT logical operator will make it false.
