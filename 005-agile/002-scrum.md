1. The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, and char â€“ those aren't considered objects and represent raw values.
1. Java platform provides wrapper classes for each of the primitive data types. These classes "wrap" the primitive in an object. (Integer, Byte, Short, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, and Char)
1. Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. 
1. The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed.
1. Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes.
