1. watch [![YouTube](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0P7nCmln7PM/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P7nCmln7PM)
1. read [Lesson: Classes and Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html)
2. create your own 1 minute video
	1. share one thing you learned
	1. share an example how you might use iterative development in your daily life
3. upload this video to YouTube
	1. set your video privacy to 'unlisted'
4. attach the video link to this assignment

## Key Concepts
1. MVP: Minimal Viable Product
1. Iterative Development: a way of breaking down the software development of a large application into smaller chunks. In iterative development, feature code is designed, developed and tested in repeated cycles.
1. Waterfall: tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.
1. Without regular user testing throughout development most Waterfall projects fail.
1. MVP focuses on the underlying customer value rather than their desired end product.
1. MVP is focused on deliverying and iterating upon a thinly sliced, working product.
1. Iterative development focuses on gathering regular feedback.
1. Class declarations can include
	1. Modifiers such as public, private, and a number of others that you will encounter later.
	1. The class name, with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
	1. The name of the class's parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
	1. A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
	1. The class body, surrounded by braces, {}.
1. Three kinds of member variables
	1. Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
	1. Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
	1. Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.
1. Method declarations can include
	1. Modifiers—such as public, private, and others you will learn about later.
	1. The return type—the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method does not return a value.
	1. The method name—with the first letter lowercase
	1. The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types, enclosed by parentheses, (). If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.
	1. An exception list—to be discussed later.
	1. The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, including the declaration of local variables, goes here.
1. Method Overloading: a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different.
