## Key Concepts

1. The Agile Manifesto was a recognition that the software industry needed a fundamental shift rather than just more best practices.  

1. Four Agile Manifesto Values

    1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
    1. Working software over comprehensive documentation 
    1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
    1. Responding to change over following a plan

1. While both sides have value, the Agile Manifesto favors the fist value over the second value. 
1. Object: In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data.
1. Class: a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. 
1. Inheritance: a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class.
1. Interface: an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols.
1. Package: organizes classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains.
