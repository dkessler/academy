# Conditional Logic

**Professor Malan introduces two concepts that should be avoided when writing code professionally.**
1) Code Comments 
2) Switch Statements. 

_An explanation for avoiding switch statements can be found in chapter 3 of [Clean Code](http://a.co/d/99nSsnx). Furthermore, the entire fourth chapter of [Clean Code](http://a.co/d/99nSsnx) is dedicated to the topic of code comments._
