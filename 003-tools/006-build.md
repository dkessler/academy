## Key Concepts
1. Dependency Management: a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the project in an automated fashion.
1. Dependencies are specified by
	1. Name
	2. Version
1. There are two types of dependencies:
	1. Direct: dependencies directly needed by an application
	1. Transitive: dependencies that are dependencies of your direct dependencies
1. Build Lifecycle: a well-defined sequence of phases, which define the order in which the goals are to be executed.
1. Continuous Deployment: a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users.
