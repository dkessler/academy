## Key Concepts
1. In Java, each code statement must end with a semicolon.
1. A block of Java code is surrounded by `{` and `}`
1. Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!
1. In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
1. public static void main(String [] args)
	1. public: anyone can access it
	1. static: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method
	1. void: method doesn't return any value
	1. main: the name of the method
1. A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes and continues until it reaches the end of the line. **Comments should be avoided (Clean Code ch 4)**
