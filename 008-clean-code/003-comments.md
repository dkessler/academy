## Key Concepts
- Polymorphism achieved through interfaces reverses the flow of control.
- If you have complete control over your dependency structure then you can avoid writing fragile, rigid and non-reusable modules.
- The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures.
- Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer’s first order of business.
- Wrap lines so you don't have to scroll when you are reading a code (120 characters)
- Code should be easily read from top to bottom.
- Add spacing between different concepts.
- Class level variable should be all declared at the top.
- Method level variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible.
- Teams, not individuals, should decide on a shared code formatting standard.
