## Key Concepts
- Meaningful naming is cruitial in building clean code.
- Use Intention-Revealing Names
- The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions.
   - why it exists, 
   - what it does, 
   - and how it is used. 
- If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.
- Avoid names that create disinformation.
- Use pronouncable names so that developers can easily talk about and understand the code.
- Use easily searchable names
- Avoid variable member prefixes
- Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names
- Methods should have verb or verb phrase names
- Choose clarity over cute or entertaining names.
- Pick a single name for each concept. Avoid using the same word for two purpose.
- Place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, and namespaces.
- The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background.
