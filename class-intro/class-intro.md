The Forge Academy is designed to guide students from no software development knowledge to working knowledge in the 
fewest number of steps. 

This path is laid out in the Google Classroom Classwork tab. All of the content was selected or created by software 
professionals. Our overriding software development philosophy stems from the Software Craftsmanship 
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) movement and Extreme Programming 
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices. 

We’ve designed this learning pathway to:
1) Learn at your own pace
2) Introduce topics in digestible chunks
3) Accelerate the time between zero software knowledge to working knowledge 
4) Layer new ideas within working knowledge

As software professionals we regularly hire new college graduates and then promptly retrain these new team members. 
We’re committed to flipping this on its head. Education should prepare students with well-rounded, marketable skills. 
We’re providing this learning pathway so students can gain a working knowledge with professional skills prior to 
landing their first software development job. 

Key Components:
1) Harvard University: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science - provides foundation concepts through engaging and 
entertaining classroom teaching. While Professor David J. Malan is one of the more engaging college instructors, he, 
like most college professors, doesn’t consistently apply professional practices within his instruction. His 
instruction includes anti-patterns such as code comments and cryptic naming conventions that are inconsistent with 
Software Craftsmanship. Nevertheless, this is a solid college course that incrementally lays foundational principles 
that help student with no computer programming background learn a broad spectrum of basic concepts. 
3) sololearn.com - introduces languages through fun, interactive tutorials. SoloLearn.com is used throughout this 
learning pathway to introduce students to new languages. 
4) Koans - are fun test-driven (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) learning exercises. Koans 
are used throughout this learning pathway to provide vital opportunities for students to exercise newly acquired 
language skills. 
5) YouTube videos - are used for two purposes. 1) Student Learning 2) Student Sharing. 
Student Learning - short, entertaining and informative YouTube videos already exist on the internet that cover 
professional software topics. Unfortunately sorting through all of the available content to locate these videos 
requires professional expertise. This Forge Academy content has been carefully selected to maximize student’s learning. 
Student Sharing - is a key learning outcome. As professional software craftspeople we believe in demonstrating working 
software and sharing what we learn with others. We require our students to do the same. All sharing on YouTube must be 
accomplished with the privacy of students in mind.
4) GitHub - is a public repository of open source software (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). 
The Forge Academy uses GitHub for two purposes. 1) Assignments Distribution 2) Assignment Collection 
Assignment Distribution - of code katas and software projects. Students will fork 
(https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) assignments and modify their fork. 
Assignment Collection - will occur through GitHub.
