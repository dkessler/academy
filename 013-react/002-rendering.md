## Key Concepts 
- There are two types of data that control a component: props and state. props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use state.
- In general, you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when you want to change it.
- The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
- While the attribute `class` is used to set the class name in HTML it is a reserved word in JSX.  So instead of using `class` JSX uses `className` instead.
