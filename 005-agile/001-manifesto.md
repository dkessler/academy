## Key Concepts

1. The Agile Manifesto was a recognition that the software industry needed a fundamental shift rather than just more best practices.  

1. Four Agile Manifesto Values

    1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
    1. Working software over comprehensive documentation 
    1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
    1. Responding to change over following a plan

1. While both sides have value, the Agile Manifesto favors the fist value over the second value.
