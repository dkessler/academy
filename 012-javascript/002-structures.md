## Key Concepts
- JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
- JavaScript and Java have nothing to do with each other.  They simply have an unfortunate common name of "Java".
- Anonymous Functions (aka Lambda Functions) do not have function names.
- JavaScript, like Java, is a case-sensitive language. This means that language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
- The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents: "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
- npm (short for Node.js package manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It consists of a 
     - command line client, also called npm, 
     - and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.
