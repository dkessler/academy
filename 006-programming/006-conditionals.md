# Conditional Logic

**Professor Malan introduces two concepts that should be avoided when writing code professionally.**
1) Code Comments 
2) Switch Statements. 

_An explanation for avoiding switch statements can be found in chapter 3 of [Clean Code](http://a.co/d/99nSsnx). Furthermore, the entire fourth chapter of [Clean Code](http://a.co/d/99nSsnx) is dedicated to the topic of code comments._

# Key Concepts
1. An exception is a problem that occurs during program execution.
1. A catch statement involves declaring the type of exception you are trying to catch.
1. The `(Exception e)` statement in the catch block is used to catch all possible Exceptions.  All exceptions inherit from Exception.
1. The throw keyword allows you to throw new exceptions from your methods.
1. A single try block can contain multiple catch blocks that handle different exceptions separately.
1. All catch blocks should be ordered from most specific to most general. 
1. ArrayLists store objects.
1. The ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data, as it is very similar to a normal array.
1. The LinkedList is better for manipulating data, such as making numerous inserts and deletes.
1. HashMap is used for storing data collections as key and value pairs.
1. A HashMap cannot contain duplicate keys.
1. If you try to get a value that is not present in your map, it returns the value of null.
1. A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
1. An Iterator is an object that enables to cycle through a collection, obtain or remove elements.
