# Programming Introduction

For this section you will learn two languages. The first language is ‘C’. This language is used in significantly less professional software development jobs. Nevertheless, ‘C’ is often taught in introductory classes within college. The reason professors use ‘C’ is because a number of professional language such as ‘C#’ and ‘Java’ are based on the fundamentals of ‘C’. 
The second language you will learn is ‘Java’. This language is required in order to get many of the jobs in the software development job market. 
While Professor Malan instructs you on ‘C’ your assignments will be in ‘Java’. Be sure to watch the videos because they provide a great context for learning ‘Java’ too.
