## Key Concepts
- Continuous integration is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. 
- Continuous delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.
- Solid CI practices are a prerequisite to Continuious Delivery.
- Continuious Integration builds provide quick feedback loops on the health of the product.
- DevOps is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other IT professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
- In HTML, links are defined with the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute specifies the destination address.
- In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag. The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The `src` attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image
- Headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
- An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.
- An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag.
- An HTML table is defined with the `<table>` tag. Each table row is defined with the `<tr>` tag. A table header is defined with the `<th>` tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the `<td>` tag.
- The HTML `<form>` element defines a form that is used to collect user input
- The `<input>` element is the most important form element. The `<input>` element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the `type` attribute.
