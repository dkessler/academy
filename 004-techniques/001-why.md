## Key Concepts

1. Object: In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data.
1. Class: a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. 
1. Inheritance: a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class.
1. Interface: an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols.
1. Package: organizes classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains.
