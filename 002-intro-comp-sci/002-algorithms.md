## Key Concepts
1. Algorithm: step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.
1. Conditional Statements, Conditional Expressions and Conditional Constructs: features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.
1. `if` block that evaluates a boolean (true/false) expression
1. `else` block that executes when the if condition evaluates to false
1. Each logic branch in an if/else is mutually exclusive and will be called only if the other logic branch is not called.
1. Switch Statement: allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case. **Avoid using this in real code**
1. Ternary Operator: the only conditional operator that takes three operands. The ternary operator is a one liner replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in java programming.
