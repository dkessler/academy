## Apply
- Story: 
	- As a pet clinic application user
	- I want to get immediate validation feedback on my owner `Telephone` input 
	- So that I get faster feedback

1) Create this story in Trello
2) Test drive this change
a) Similar test found in the AddPetPage constructor.
3) Make coding changes
a) The input fields use `th:replace` in `createOrUpdateOwnerForm.html `
b) The `th:replace` uses the fragment `inputField.html`. This is where your changes will go. Don't try to make changes to the input field in `createOrUpdateOwnerForm.html ` because they will just get replaced by the `th:replace`.
4) create a video demo for this user story
