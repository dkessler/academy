# Section Introduction

In this section you will start to run and modify a real-world Pet Clinic web application. This Java web application is similar to many of the applications created and maintained in corporate environments. Lessons going forward will use this application to apply new ideas and technologies. This application has been test driven and has comprehensive test coverage. 

As you make changes to this web application be sure to 
1) add user stories to your Trello board with clear acceptance criteria
2) modify and/or write new tests to drive your changes
3) run all of the tests and verify that they are green before you commit your changes to Git
4) demonstrate each user story
