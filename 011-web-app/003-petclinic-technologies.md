## Key Concepts
- List is an ordered collection.
- Set is an unordered collection and doesn't contain duplicate values.
- The Map interface represents a key-value pair. Maps don't contain duplicate keys.
- HashMap does not preserve order.
- TreeMap preserves order
- LinkedList items have references to previous and next items in the same LinkedList.
