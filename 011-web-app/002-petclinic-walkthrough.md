## Key Concepts
- Polymorphism is briefly described as “one interface, many implementations”.
- What are the main differences between abstract classes and interfaces?
    - An abstract class can provide `partial implementation` while an interface can not.
    - A class can `only extend one abstract class` while the same class can implement several interfaces.
    - An abstract class can have `non-abstract methods` while all interface methods are abstract.
    - An abstract class can have `instance variables` while an interface cannot have instance variables.
    - An abstract class can have `any visibility` (public, private, protected, etc.) while an interface can only be public.
    - An abstract class can `contain constructors` while an interface cannot contain constructors
