- Read chapters 3 in Clean Code (http://a.co/d/c31QNpN)

## Apply
- Create User Stories http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/ stories on your Trello Board in the "To Do" List.
- Move each story from "To Do" to Doing when you start working on it. Then move it to "Done" once you complete the story.
- Commit to Git every Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle.
- Once youâ€™ve Test Driven your code, create a video demonstration of your working code.

## Turn In Your Assignment
- Add a link to your Trello Board
- Add a link to your GitHub repository
- Add links to your story demo videos

## Key Concepts
- Rigidity is code that has high coupling with other parts of the code so that when you make a coding change you must modify other unrelated parts of the code.
- Fragility is code that breaks other unrelated parts of the code when you make a coding change.
- Dependency Inversion Principle is a specific form of decoupling software modules. When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. 
- The Dependency Inversion Principle states:
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- The first rule of functions is that they should be small.
- Indenting blocks of code makes it easier to read and understand.
- Methods should only do one thing.
- Avoid using switch statements.
- Use descriptive method names.
- Keep method parameter lists short.
- Methods should not have any side effects.  It should only do what the method name describes.
- Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion.
- Follow the DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Writing software is like any other kind of writing. When you write a paper or an article, you get your thoughts down first, then you massage it until it reads well. The first draft might be clumsy and disorganized, so you wordsmith it and restructure it and refine it until it reads the way you want it to read.
- Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written.
- Your functions will be short, well named, and nicely organized. But never forget that your real goal is to tell the story of the system.
