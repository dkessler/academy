- fork https://github.com/pairing4good/fizz-buzz-kata.git
- clone your fork
- commit on green
- push your completed project
- attach a link to your GitHub fork to this assignment

## Apply
- Create User Stories http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/FizzBuzz-Kata stories (green) from Feature 2 & 3 on your Trello Board in the "To Do" List.
- Move each story from "To Do" to Doing when you start working on it.  Then move it to "Done" once you complete the story.
- Commit to Git every Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle.
- Once you’ve Test Driven your code, create a video demonstration of your working code.
  - Upload your demo to YouTube (unlisted) and attach a video link to this assignment

## Key Concepts
1. Kata: an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.
1. Test Driven Development (TDD) has three phases
   1. Red: write a failing test
   1. Green: make the failing test pass
   1. Refactor: improve the code
1. Source Control: commit your changes once you reach a green state.
1. Commit working code frequently so that
   1. can rollback to a good working state
   1. clear commit history
1. Good commit statements
   1. explain why you made a change
   1. describes the business value
1. XP includes:
   1. A philosophy of software development based on the values of 
     1. communication, 
     1. feedback, 
     1. simplicity, 
     1. courage, and 
     1. respect.
   1. A body of practices proven useful in improving software development. The practices complement each other, amplifying their effects. They are chosen as expressions of the values.
   1. A set of complementary principles, intellectual techniques for translating the values into practice, useful when there isn’t a practice handy for your particular problem.
   1. A community that shares these values and many of the same practices.
1. It is distinguished from other methodologies by:
   1. Its short development cycles, resulting in early, concrete, and continuing feedback.
   1. Its incremental planning approach, which quickly comes up with an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project.
   1. Its ability to flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality, responding to changing business needs.
   1. Its reliance on automated tests written by programmers, customers, and testers to monitor the progress of development, to allow the system to evolve, and to catch defects early.
   1. Its reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
   1. Its reliance on an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.
   1. Its reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals with ordinary talent.
   1. Its reliance on practices that work with both the short-term instincts of the team members and the long-term interests of the project
