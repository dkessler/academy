## Key Concepts
- Rigidity is code that has high coupling with other parts of the code so that when you make a coding change you must modify other unrelated parts of the code.
- Fragility is code that breaks other unrelated parts of the code when you make a coding change.
- When high level modules know about low level modules it violates Inversion of Control.
