## Key Concepts
1. MVP: Minimal Viable Product
1. Iterative Development: a way of breaking down the software development of a large application into smaller chunks. In iterative development, feature code is designed, developed and tested in repeated cycles.
1. Waterfall: tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.
1. Without regular user testing throughout development most Waterfall projects fail.
1. MVP focuses on the underlying customer value rather than their desired end product.
1. MVP is focused on deliverying and iterating upon a thinly sliced, working product.
1. Iterative development focuses on gathering regular feedback.
