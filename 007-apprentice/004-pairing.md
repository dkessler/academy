## Discover
-  watch [![YouTube](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhV4TaZaB84/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhV4TaZaB84)
- Read chapters 7, 8 & 9 in Extreme Programming Explained (http://a.co/d/5RExPZU)

## Try
-  Working on a problem together with another person.
-  Pair for at least 30 minutes
-  Switch Drivers half way through the pairing session
-  Attach a link to a 1 minute video explaining what pair programming is and describing your experience.

## Apply
- Create User Stories http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/Tennis-Kata stories (green) on your Trello Board in the "To Do" List.
- Move each story from "To Do" to Doing when you start working on it.  Then move it to "Done" once you complete the story.
- Commit to Git every Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle.
- Once you’ve Test Driven your code, create a video demonstration of your working code.

## Turn In Your Assignment
- Add a link to your Trello Board
- Add a link to your GitHub repository
- Add links to your story demo videos

## Key Concepts
1. Pair Driver - focused on the here and now
1. Pair Navigator - focused on where you are going
1. Pair Programming power is the willingness to be vulnerable.
1. Both pair should be focused on a single computer
1. Primary Practices
   1. Sit Together: but "tearing down the cubicle walls before the team is ready is counter-productive"
   1. Whole Team: a cross-functional team.
   1. Informative Workspace: a workspace that meets human needs, and a place for big visible charts.
   1. Energized Work: a reinterpretation of "40-hour week" and "sustainable pace"
   1. Pair Programming
   1. Stories: "units of customer-visible functionality." And, "Every attempt I’ve seen to computerize stories has failed to provide a fraction of the value of having real cards on a real wall."
   1. Weekly Cycle: an iteration: plan, write tests & code.
   1. Quarterly Cycle: plan a quarter using themes.
   1. Slack: include things that can be dropped if you get behind.
   1. Ten-Minute Build: automatically build and test everything.
   1. Continuous Integration
   1. Test-First Programming
   1. Incremental Design
1. Corollary Practices
   1. Real Customer Involvement
   1. Incremental Deployment
   1. Team Continuity
   1. Shrinking Teams: a proposal to reduce teams by making one person as idle as possible, rather than easing the load on everybody. Another element derived from lean thinking.
   1. Root Cause Analysis: the five whys.
   1. Shared Code
   1. Code and Tests: as the primary permanent artifacts.
   1. Single Code Base: one code stream. "Don’t make more versions of your source code… fix the underlying problem."
   1. Daily Deployment
   1. Negotiated Scope Contract
   1. Pay-per-use: "money is the ultimate feedback"
